  "description": "A small script for zooming IMG elements with the mousewheel/trackpad.  Wheelzoom works by replacing the img element's src with a transparent image, then using the original src as a background image, which can be sized and positioned. Wheelzoom is dependency free, doesn't add any extra elements to the DOM, or change the positioning of the IMG element.",
